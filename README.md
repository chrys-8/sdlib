# SDLIB (Some Data Library)

*Very in-progress.* Currently working on TOML parsing every other weekend. Cannot guarantee it will
build for you, but it works on my machine.

## Compilation

To compile: (change for your compiler/operating system)
```
g++ -o .\test.exe -std=c++20 -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic *.cpp
```

Then run the output `test` executable.
